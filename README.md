# BINF5507-Assignment-1
This reposistory includes two folders, "Scripts" and "Data". 

In "Data" you will find two csv files, "messy_data.csv" and "cleaned_data.csv"
In "Scripts" you will find two python scripts, "data_preprocessor.py" and "main.py". 
"data_preprocessor.py" is a script desgined to preprocess a provided csv file to improve predictive accuracy. In "main.py" it is applied to the csv file, "messy_data.csv". The code in this script then saves a cleaned version of the csv file as "cleaned_data.csv". 
Initially, this project was supposed to have the "Main" script as a jupyter notebook, however due to technical issues, PyCharm was used to run all code and "main" is saved as .py file.

Prior to running any code ensure you have the messy_data.csv file saved in the same directory as the main.py file. Code can then be run to recieve output.

AI DISCLAIMER: AI was utilized for debugging code to ensure all scripts run accordingly.
